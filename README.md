ðŸš¦ Traffic Accident Analysis & Prediction â€“ Python (Jupyter Notebook) Report ðŸš—

This project analyzes traffic accident data using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging data science techniques to extract insights and predict accident trends. The dataset includes details like location, time, weather conditions, and severity, aiding in traffic safety improvements.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps in the Analysis:
âœ… Data Cleaning & Preprocessing â€“ Handling missing values, data formatting, and feature engineering.
âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Understanding accident patterns using statistical analysis and visualizations.
âœ… Data Visualization â€“ Creating insightful plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations & Insights:
ðŸ“Œ Accident Severity Analysis â€“ Categorizing accidents into minor, moderate, and severe.
ðŸ“Œ Time & Location-Based Trends â€“ Identifying accident hotspots and high-risk time periods.
ðŸ“Œ Weather Impact on Accidents â€“ Analyzing how conditions like rain, fog, and snow contribute to accidents.
ðŸ“Œ Road Conditions & Safety Insights â€“ Examining how road infrastructure affects accident occurrences.

ðŸš€ Impact & Benefits:
This Python-based analysis helps traffic authorities, urban planners, and policymakers leverage data-driven decision-making to improve road safety, optimize traffic management, and develop preventive strategies.
